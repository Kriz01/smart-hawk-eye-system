# Smart hawk Eye System
The system is implemented to optimise the security check process implemented
on the entrance of organisations. It successfully recognises and obtains the
number from the number plate of the vehicle. The approach follows an OCR
technique that includes image processing, number plate extraction, segmentation
followed by verifying with database. Then the user of the vehicle is verified
using fingerprint biometric authentication in order to provide additional security.
